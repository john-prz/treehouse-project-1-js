  Create the `printQuote` function to:
   - call the `getRandomQuote` function and assign it to a variable.
   - use the properties of the quote object stored in the variable to
     create your HTML string.
   - use conditionals to make sure the optional properties exist before
     they are added to the HTML string.
   - set the `innerHTML` of the `quote-box` div to the HTML string.
